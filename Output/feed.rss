Let me just say, I love it...mostly. While the iPad Pro is powerful, fast, and fun to use, it takes getting used to the subtle differences between GarageBand iOS and the Mac app. The addition of trackpad support has made the editing process much easier and intuitive. That, combined with the Apple Pencil and you can get creative when editing. For all the good that the iPad brings to music production, there are still some things Iâ€™d like to see improved.</p><h2>A brief gear history</h2><p>As a young twenty-something living in the greater Boston area with no real responsibilities other than my job and paying rent, I would spend most of my extra cash on guitars and gear to go with them. At one point I had six guitars. Over the years I sold off and traded most of my equipment and guitars. Now a thirty-something with a family, mortgage, and responsibilities up to my eyeballs, I have to be more selective on the large purchase items like a new guitar. Iâ€™m down to two guitars, a small amp, three pedals, and my recording gear.</p><p>Ok, on to my current setup.</p><h2>Gear, gear, gear</h2><p>Iâ€™ll start with a list so you have an overview of what I use and then Iâ€™ll go into more detail on the setup.</p><h3>Instruments</h3><ul><li>[Ovation acoustic electric]</li><li>[Squire Telecaster] ### Amplifier</li><li>[Orange Crush] ### Headphones</li><li>[Sony MDR7506] ### Effects Pedals</li><li>[Reverb]</li><li>[Delay]</li><li>[Looper] ### MIDI Controller</li><li>[Akai MPK Mini] ### Microphone</li><li>[MXL Mics 770 Cardioid Condenser Microphone] ### Audio Interface</li><li>[Focusrite Scarlett 2i2]</li></ul><p>I got most of these items on sale or second hand. Iâ€™ve had my Ovation for over ten years, and my Telecaster plays like a $3000 guitar but costs less than $200 ðŸ‘Œ. The guitar pedal signal flow starts with the reverb, then to the delay, and ends on the looper before hitting the Scarlett 2i2. The output of the Scarlett goes into the Orange amp, and also to my headphones.</p><p>The Scarlett and MPK connect to a USB-C hub which is connected to my iPad. Thatâ€™s it. I open GarageBand, choose my input, and start recording.</p><h3>Settings in GarageBand</h3><p>By default GarageBand records 8 bars and then either stops or loops back to record over itself. I found this frustrating at first because it wasnâ€™t clear how to turn it off. You can enable multi take recording so youâ€™re able to play the same 8 bars until you get a take you like. Changing the tempo is hidden in the settings popover window, which in my opinion should be on the main view by either tapping or a slider. <code>Run in background</code>is something youâ€™re going to want on. This will allow you to keep your recording going while you switch to another audio app. You might want to turn on 24-Bit audio as well if you want a higher quality recording. The rest of the settings are straight forward and more geared towards your song.</p><h2>Recording</h2><p>This is the easy part of the whole process. There are a few ways to get your recording started. If you have a keyboard connected, simply press the <code>R</code> key, otherwise press the red recording button ðŸ”´. You can choose your metronome sound and a count in timer in settings. The multi-take recording isnâ€™t that easy to find at first. Select the track you want, then the track settings button that looks like three faders, then <code>Track Settings</code> and finally under <code>Recording</code> is where youâ€™ll see it.</p><h2>Editing</h2><p>The hardest part about editing your sessions is finding where to edit the audio or MIDI recording. On the track recording long press, or three finger press on the trackpad to bring up the options menu. Press <code>edit</code> to bring up the <code>Editor View</code></p><h2>Sharing</h2><h2>Importing GarageBand for Mac on iPad</h2><p>I want to get my only real complaint out of the way here. Why canâ€™t we import files from the Mac app to the iOS version?</p><h2>Gear upgrades</h2>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
