ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Josh.

I have a mixed bag of skills when it comes to software development. I'm mostly self-taught and I like to dabble in the design world.  I've worked for all stages of companies, and has experience working with every kind of team out there.

I've been the sole developer for a few start-up companies, where I also was in charge of designing the product. But that's all in the past these days. I'm currrently developing iOS and Mac apps over at [Big Nerd Ranch](https://bignerdranch.com) ðŸ¤ .
