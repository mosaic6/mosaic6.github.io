ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Josh.

I have a mixed bag of skills when it comes to software development. I'm mostly self-taught and I like to dabble in the design world.  I've worked for all stages of companies, and has experience working with every kind of team out there. 

I've been the sole developer for a few start-up companies, where I also was in charge of designing the product. 

My goal is always to build the best product, whether itâ€™s for clients or myself. I love learning new technologies and methods of development to try out.
